        title: 'Personalization',
        body: "# Empowering Personalization in Marketing with Zesty.io\n\nToday's digital consumers expect content that is tailored to their needs, preferences, and behaviors. Consequently, personalization has emerged as a pivotal marketing strategy. Zesty.io, a state-of-the-art Web Content Management System (WCMS), provides a robust suite of personalization options to meet these evolving needs. By leveraging personalization, businesses can boost conversion rates and foster customer loyalty, driving overall business success. In this product page we delve into some of the personalization capabilities of Zesty.io and illuminate their high level concepts and business value. \n\n## Personalization Tagging via Content Relationships\n\nZesty.io allows marketers to tag any content made in the system with personalization tags, this is done using content model relationship fields. Easy to configure and to use once implemented, any content author, marketer, or developer, can simply tag any content they make to a persona, category, or any generic tag. Tagged content is easily requested through headless API calls or in-template logic to personalize the any experience. This content tagging to power personalization is foundational to the Zesty.io system and can be leveraged at anytime, to new content or existing content. Once content is tagged, any strategy listed below is possible.\n\n## Content Fetching by Personalization Tags\n\nZesty.io's system enables businesses to fetch specific content pieces based on personalization tags as mentioned above. This means your website can dynamically serve content tailored to individual users' needs or preferences. It fosters a deeper connection with your audience, thereby boosting engagement and conversions. \n\nThis is the most common way to personalize a page, imagine your user has a preference for financial content, then any content tagged with \"financial\" will be served from Zesty.io as an available option to load in experiences.\n\n## Content Personalization with Cookies\n\nUsing cookies, Zesty.io can fetch content that aligns with the user's browsing history and behavior. Cookies can be set when a user browsers specific areas, at time of login, or set by external data. Using cookies enables the provision of highly targeted content that resonates with the user, enhancing user experience, improving retention rates, and increasing the likelihood of conversions.\n\nHow it works is a cookie is stored based upon a trigger, a user selection in-app, a user browser an article or a category page, a user selection preferences. The cookie should set a value like \"car articles\" or \"plants\", and that value is used to query for content that has tags that match those values. In Zesty.io, a content model is setup with matching values, and content tagged with those values will return.\n\n## Content Personalization with UTM Tags\n\nUTM (Urchin Tracking Module) tags are commonly used to track campaign performance and user behavior. UTM tags became common in the early 2000s and stuck as a standard. It's often you see tools like Google Analytics, Ads, and other marketing software rely on UTM tags for reporting. Since this is the case, Zesty.io lets you use the same UTM tags already setup, but for content personalization, serving users with content based on their past interactions with your digital campaigns. This tailored approach can significantly improve your campaign's performance, lead generation, and customer acquisition.\n\nThis strategy can be paired with the cookie strategy to create a cascading personalization effect across many web experiences. This is done by intercepting UTM tags and setting associated cookies to match desired personalization values.\n\n## Content Personalization with Query Parameters\n\nZesty.io's functionality extends to personalizing content based on query parameters. This means you can serve dynamic content based on the parameters users gain from clicking query parameter loaded links, searches, or inbound links to your site. This version of personalization can be leveraged without have a user in your system, and also doesn't require cookie acceptance or does it violate GDPR or CCPR without requiring permissions. Like all forms of personalization, this method can enhance user satisfaction, increase page views, and improve conversion rates.\n\nAs an example, imagine there is a link in your website which opens the page to \"acme.com/news/?category=financial\", the template accessed the category value and fetches content that have been tagged wit the \"financial\" tag, hence rendering a personalization page for the user. This can also be extended to store a cookie with the key value \"category=financial\" which can be used persistently in the current user session or when the user returns to serve relevant content or targeted CTA (call to action) experiences. \n\n## Page Design Control with Personalization Tags\n\nZesty.io also allows businesses to control the design of a page based on personalization tags. This functionality gives you the power to alter the look and feel of a page depending on user preferences or behaviors, leading to a truly personalized user experience. This could include color changes, image changes, content changes, or fully layout changes. This is often leveraged with localization based personalization that is state, country based, or at random. It can be used along with A/B testing as well. This improved user experience can translate to increased user engagement, brand loyalty, and customer lifetime value.\n\n## Synchronizing Personalization Tags from CRMs to CMSs\n\nOne of Zesty.io's standout features is the ability to synchronize personalization tags between Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems and the CMS. It ensures that your content management efforts are in harmony with customer data insights, leading to more accurate and impactful content personalization. This synchronization can enhance the relevance of your content, improve customer relationships, and boost sales conversion rates.\n\nThis is done by synchronizing the personalization tags in an external system like [Salesforce](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.customize_tag_settings.htm&type=5) with an automated script that polls and consistently updates a personalization content model your Zesty.io instance. The model it updates will retain the data in your CRM and allow for content to be tagged in Zesty.io so it will be fetched when the CRM tag is present in your experiences. \n\nOnce this is setup, all user in Zesty.io will have access to tag any content with personalization tags that exist in the businesses external CRM. \n\n## Personalization in Zesty.io in Summary\n\nIn the era of the customer-centric business model, personalization is no longer optional - it's a necessity.

        title: 'Automatic APIs',
        body: "Content Models created in Schema automatically create dynamic API endpoints to easily access content for building experiences in presentation layers, powering apps, or building read/write applications.\n\n## Instant API\n\nZesty.io's Instant API is a feature that automatically creates a consumable API for every piece of content you create or update on the platform. This means, as soon as you create or edit a content item in your Zesty.io content management system (CMS), the platform instantly generates a RESTful API endpoint for that content.\n\nThese automatically generated APIs are fully structured and standardized, meaning they adhere to best practices for API design and provide organized, predictable outputs. As a result, developers can quickly and easily pull your content into any application, on any device, in any programming language that can make HTTP requests and parse JSON or XML.\n\nThe Instant API feature can be a game-changer for businesses aiming to deliver consistent and synchronized content across multiple channels (a practice known as omnichannel content delivery or headless CMS). It significantly speeds up the process of making content accessible to developers and reduces the time and effort needed to manually create APIs for each content item.\n\nIn summary, Zesty.io's Instant API is an automatic API generation feature that can dramatically speed up and simplify the process of making your content accessible to multiple channels and applications.\n\n## GQL API\n\nZesty.io's GQL API refers to the GraphQL API feature that Zesty.io offers.

Instead of having multiple endpoints that return fixed data structures, GraphQL APIs typically have a single endpoint that returns flexible and client-specified data structures.\n\nWith the Zesty.io GraphQL (GQL) API, developers have the ability to request specific data they need, which can greatly reduce the amount of data transferred over the network and improve the performance of applications. They can query multiple resources, and multiple instances of those resources, in a single request, and the API will return a JSON object shaped exactly as specified in the request. This makes it ideal for applications that need to aggregate complex data, such as mobile apps, or in a microservices architecture where many services need to be aggregated into a single response.\n\nFor businesses, this means less over-fetching or under-fetching of data, leading to better efficiency and performance. It also provides a significant reduction in the amount of code needed for data requests, which means a cleaner codebase and less time spent on data management. Furthermore, the ability to aggregate responses can simplify the process of retrieving and working with data, leading to faster development and easier maintenance.\n\n## Custom JSON APIs with Parsley\n\nOne off files that output to JSON can be created in Zesty.io to mix and match content and external resources. Creating a custom JSON endpoint using Parsley on Zesty.io CMS provides numerous benefits for both developers and businesses alike. Here are the main advantages:\n\n**1. Customization:** With custom JSON endpoints, you can tailor the structure and content of your API responses to match your exact needs. You can decide which fields to include, how to nest your data, and much more. This level of customization allows you to shape your API in a way that best serves your application's requirements.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** By only including the data you need in your API responses, you can reduce the payload size and make your applications run more efficiently. This is particularly useful for mobile apps or other bandwidth-sensitive applications where unnecessary data can slow down performance.\n\n**3. Consistency:** With custom endpoints, you can ensure consistency across your APIs. This makes it easier for developers to understand and use your APIs, as they will follow a predictable structure.\n\n**4. Flexibility:** You can create multiple custom endpoints to serve different parts of your application or different applications altogether. For instance, you can have one endpoint for your mobile app and another for your web app, each optimized for their specific requirements.\n\n**5. Easy Integration:** Parsley, Zesty.ioâ€™s server-side scripting language, helps you create dynamic content and layouts. Combined with the custom JSON endpoint, it makes it easier to integrate Zesty.io CMS with other applications and services.\n\n**6. Headless Capabilities:** By creating a custom JSON endpoint, you're essentially creating a headless CMS where the content management system is decoupled from the presentation layer. This allows you to deliver the content to any platform or device while maintaining a single source of truth.\n\nIn summary, creating a custom JSON endpoint on Zesty.io CMS using Parsley gives you the power to serve exactly what you want, how you want it, and where you want it, providing an unparalleled level of control and efficiency in your content delivery.\n\n## Custom Data Endpoints with Parsley\n\nCreating custom data endpoints using Parsley on Zesty.io CMS offers several key benefits, notably enhancing data organization, integrating any data format possible, optimizing content delivery, and providing robust compatibility with various platforms. Let's explore each in detail:\n\n**1. Tailored Data Structure:** With custom data endpoints, you have the power to define your own data structure.

        body: "# Automatic File Optimization and Template Features\n\nIn the dynamic digital world, efficient website management is crucial for businesses and marketing teams alike. Zesty.io, a robust and flexible content management system, offers a variety of template optimization options to ensure optimal site performance and user experience. These features, ranging from Stylesheet SCSS/SASS Transpilation and File Minification to Automatic Global CDN Delivery, streamline the development process, improve site speed, enhance SEO, and facilitate global content delivery. This article delves into these capabilities, shedding light on their technical intricacies and the profound business and marketing value they bring.\n\n## Stylesheet SCSS/SASS Transpilation\n\nSCSS/SASS is a popular preprocessor scripting language used to extend the capabilities of regular CSS. In Zesty.io, SCSS/SASS files are automatically transpiled into regular CSS. This feature saves developers a significant amount of time and allows them to write DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) CSS. Moreover, SCSS/SASS makes your stylesheets more readable and easier to maintain which is critical for businesses, ensuring their website remains consistent and visually engaging for their marketing efforts.\n\n## File Minification\n\nZesty.io automatically minifies JavaScript and CSS files, reducing their size and hence improving the website's loading speed. This technical process is important for businesses, as it significantly enhances the user experience by providing quicker page loads, leading to better engagement and conversion rates for marketing campaigns.\n\n## JS/CSS Single File Concatenation\n\nWith Zesty.io, all JavaScript and CSS files can be concatenated into a single file respectively. This reduces HTTP requests, further improving website load speed. From a business perspective, this enhancement is paramount for user retention, as slow loading times can cause potential customers to leave the site. Faster load times also contribute to SEO, which is an essential part of any digital marketing strategy.\n\n## Automatic Head Creation\n\nZesty.io automatically creates the head section of a website's HTML. This functionality saves developers time and ensures the correct metadata is in place for SEO. For businesses, this feature ensures their website meets standard SEO requirements without needing intensive manual work, providing a valuable boost to marketing efforts.\n\n## Bottom Loading JS Option\n\nIn Zesty.io, developers have the option to load JavaScript files at the bottom of the HTML file. This approach allows the browser to render the webpage without waiting for the JS file to load, leading to improved site speed and user experience. This aspect of optimization is key for businesses and marketing, as site speed is a factor in both user retention and SEO ranking.\n\n## Draft / Production Modes\n\nZesty.io allows developers to work in draft mode before pushing changes to production. This means that businesses can make and test changes without affecting the live site. For marketing teams, this ensures that their campaign rollouts are seamless and error-free.\n\n## Automatic Global CDN Delivery\n\nZesty.io automatically delivers your website content through a Content Delivery Network (CDN). This results in faster content delivery regardless of the geographical location of the user. This is incredibly beneficial for businesses operating globally, ensuring all users receive an optimal experience. For marketing teams, this means their campaigns reach their audience quickly and reliably, regardless of their location.\n",

    body: '# Micro DAM (Media Storage)\n\n## What is a Micro DAM?\n\nA Micro DAM (digital asset manager) is a Zesty.io service for managing files that are served publicly. Designed as an abstract file system, the Micro DAM allows file organization that mimics an operating system directory structure. We brand it a Micro DAM because it does not have the same features as a fully featured enterprise DAM. For example, it does not handle digital right management (DRM), and assumes that every file added to it will be accessed publicly.\n\n## What type of Files can be Stored on the Micro DAM?\n\nMany file types may be uploaded to a Micro DAM. Examples include images (PNG, JPG, GIF), PDFs, Video (MP4, OGG), Fonts (OTF, WOFF, TTF), SVGs, YAML, Markdown, Javascript, CSS, etc.\n\n## File Life Cycle\n\nOnce files are uploaded to the Micro DAM (through the content manager or directly through the API), they are copied to cloud storage on Google Cloud Platform. From there they are propagated to the multiple edge point-of-presence (POP) points across the world. Files live on the Micro DAM until they are deleted from the Micro DAM through the API or the media section of the content manager.\n\n### File Delivery & Content Delivery Network (CDN) Details\n\nFiles load to the client device (mobile phone, desktop, game console etc.) from the closest POP server they are located on. If the file is not located on a POP server, the POP server makes a request to Zesty.io (the origin) for the file. At that point Zesty.io transfers the file from cloud storage to the POP server. Any request to that file will be loaded from the POP server thereafter. The file will remain "cached" on the POP server for a 24 hour period. This whole cycle ensures fast delivery while delivering fresh files.\n\n> POPs are high-density servers with 24 TB of SSDs, 768 GB of RAM, and 4 x 25 Gigabit Ethernet. Delivery is sub-millisecond Time to First Byte (TTFB) on the 99th%.\\*\n\n### This map shows all the Point of Presence (POP) servers across the World.\n\n\n\n',

        body: "# Traditional HTML/CSS Pages: Efficiency and Suitability for Marketing Applications\n\nZesty.io supports the creation of traditional HTML/CSS pages, offering a robust interface for writing and managing HTML and CSS files. But why is this important? In certain contexts, especially in marketing applications, traditional HTML/CSS pages can offer numerous benefits. Let's explore these benefits in more detail.\n\n## Rapid Load Times\n\nTraditional HTML/CSS pages tend to load faster because they don't rely on JavaScript to render content. This is especially important for marketing websites where every second counts. Slow loading times can deter potential customers, making them leave the site before they've seen what you have to offer.\n\n## High Compatibility\n\nHTML/CSS has excellent compatibility across different browsers and devices. This ensures that your marketing content is accessible to a broad audience, regardless of the device or browser they are using. This wide reach is invaluable in marketing where reaching the widest audience possible is crucial.\n\n## SEO Friendliness\n\nHTML/CSS pages are easier for search engine bots to crawl and index. This improves the site's visibility on search engine results pages, leading to increased traffic. In marketing, visibility is key, and HTML/CSS can give you an SEO edge.\n\n## Lower Development Costs\n\nCreating HTML/CSS pages can be more cost-effective, as it often requires less time and fewer resources than complex dynamic websites. For marketing applications where budgets can be tight, this is a significant advantage.\n\n## Easy Updates and Maintenance\n\nWith HTML/CSS, making updates or changes to the website is straightforward. This simplicity can be beneficial in a marketing context, where timely updates are often needed for campaigns, new product launches, and more.\n\n## Improved Accessibility\n\nHTML/CSS websites often have better accessibility than sites heavily reliant on JavaScript. This means your site is more likely to be accessible to users with disabilities, broadening your audience and demonstrating your company's commitment to inclusivity.\n\n## Robustness and Reliability\n\nHTML/CSS websites are less likely to experience issues due to browser incompatibilities or JavaScript errors. This reliability ensures your marketing messages are always available to your audience.\n\n## Greater Control Over Design\n\nHTML/CSS gives you fine-grained control over the design of your pages. This control is vital in marketing, where the look and feel of a site can greatly impact user perceptions and engagement.\n\n## Simplicity and Clarity\n\nHTML/CSS pages are simple and clear, making them easy for users to navigate. This user-friendliness can improve user engagement and increase conversion rates in marketing applications.\n\n## Live Preview Feature\n\nZesty.io's live preview feature for HTML/CSS pages allows developers to see the impact of their changes in real time. This is particularly useful in a marketing context, where being able to quickly iterate and make adjustments based on feedback can make all the difference.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are certainly situations where a more complex, dynamic website might be required, traditional HTML/CSS pages can offer significant advantages, especially for marketing applications. With Zesty.io's support for HTML/CSS pages, these benefits are within easy reach.",
